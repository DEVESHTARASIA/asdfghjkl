## Inspiration

Throughout history, we've invented better and better ways of interfacing with machines. The **mouse**, the **VirtualBoy**, the **nub mouse thing** on ThinkPads. But we weren't satisfied with the current state of input devices. As computers become more and more personal and more and more a part of our daily lives, we need better, **more efficient** ways of interacting with them. One of the biggest inefficiencies in modern desktop computing is moving your hands from the keyboard to the track pad. So we got rid of that. Yup. Really.

Introducing **asdfghjkl** , a revolution in computer-human interface design patterns, by team "Keyboard as Trackpad".

After getting the MVP working, I exclusively used **asdfghjkl** for navigation and input while developing the app.

It's built in Swift 2.0 (for the easy C interoperability) and partially Obj-C for certain functions.

## What's next for **asdfghjkl**

Apple partnership is in the works. NASA partnership is going smoothly; soon the inhabitants of the ISS will be able to get more done, easier, thanks to mandatory **asdfghjkl** usage.

## Info

The correct way to pronounce **asdfghjkl** is "asdfghjkl". Please don't get it wrong. Additionally, the only way to type **asdfghjkl** is by sliding your finger across the entire home row. Just don't hold _Control_, or your mouse will fly to the right!
